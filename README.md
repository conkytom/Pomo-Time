This simple, but incredibly helpful, application was created to help users utilize the power of the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), a time management [life hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_hack) designed to break up a person's work into intense, but manageable 25 minute increments with breaks in between to unwind and clear the mind.

This minimalist app provides the user with a simple countdown timer that dings after 25 minutes(one Pomodoro), and then provides them with a 5 minute break.  After 4 Pomodoros it automatically prompts them to take a 15 or 30 minute break.  It also indicates the time at which the last Pomodoro, or break, ended so they can keep track of their timing in case they were not in front of their computer when the timer ended.  It gives the user the option to end the Pomodoro or break early in the event that it is not conducive to what they are doing, as well as providing a list of completed tasks that they can add to that allows them to see what they have accomplished.

[Try out the demo for yourself.](https://conkytom-pomodoro.herokuapp.com/)  The demo version has work sessions and break sessions that are only 5 seconds long just so you can test out the functionality of the Pomodoro sessions, and see that after 4 of them the user is allowed to take a 15 or 30 minute break.
